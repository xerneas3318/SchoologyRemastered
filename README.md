## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
1. **API Keys** (Optional but recommended for full functionality):
   - [Google Gemini API Key](https://ai.google.dev/)
   - [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or Download** the repository
2. **Configure API Keys** (Optional):
   ```bash
   cp config.example.js config.js
   # Edit config.js and add your API keys
   ```
3. **Install Extension**:

   **Chrome:**
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the project folder

   **Firefox:**
   - Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging`
   - Click "This Firefox"
   - Click "Load Temporary Add-on" and select `manifest.json`

## üéØ Usage

### Basic Workflow
1. **Navigate** to a Schoology assignment
2. **Click** on a file link to load it
3. **Use voice commands** or click buttons to:
   - Download files
   - Extract text
   - Read documents aloud
   - Add voice comments
   - Generate AI feedback summaries

### Voice Commands
Enable voice recognition by clicking the microphone button, then use natural language commands:
- "Extract text" - Extract and copy text to clipboard
- "Read aloud" - Start text-to-speech
- "Add comment" - Record a voice comment
- "Show comments" - View all comments
- "Summarize comments" - Generate AI feedback

### File Processing
The extension automatically:
- Detects and caches Schoology files
- Extracts text using PDF.js or OCR
- Provides multiple processing options
- Maintains file cache across sessions

## üîß Configuration

### API Keys (Optional)
Create a `config.js` file based on `config.example.js`:

```javascript
const config = {
  GEMINI_API_KEY: 'your_gemini_api_key_here',
  OPENAI_API_KEY: 'your_openai_api_key_here'
};
```

### Features Without API Keys
- File download and caching
- Text extraction (PDF.js and OCR)
- Voice commands and text-to-speech
- Comment system (local storage)
- Basic feedback generation (local processing)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Components
- **Background Service Worker**: File detection and caching
- **Content Script**: Main application logic and UI
- **Voice System**: Speech recognition and text-to-speech
- **AI Integration**: Multiple API fallbacks for reliability

### Technologies
- **Manifest V3**: Modern browser extension framework
- **PDF.js**: Client-side PDF processing
- **Tesseract.js**: OCR text extraction
- **Web Speech API**: Voice recognition and synthesis
- **Browser Storage API**: Persistent data management

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Comments not saving**: Try "Debug storage" voice command
2. **Voice recognition not working**: Check microphone permissions
3. **Files not loading**: Ensure you're on a Schoology page
4. **API errors**: Check your API keys in config.js

### Debug Commands
- "Debug storage" - Check browser storage contents
- "Reload comments" - Force reload comments from storage
- "Help" - Show all available voice commands

## üìä Performance

- **File Processing**: 2-5 seconds for typical documents
- **Voice Recognition**: <2 seconds average response time
- **AI Summarization**: 2-7 seconds depending on API
- **Memory Usage**: <150MB for typical operation

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **Local Processing**: All file processing happens client-side
- **API Security**: Only text content sent to AI services
- **No Data Collection**: No user data transmitted to external servers
- **Secure Storage**: Comments stored locally in browser
